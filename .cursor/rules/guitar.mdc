# Project Rules – Guitar (Chord a Day Journey)

This file defines the **mandatory specific rules** for the **Chord a Day Journey** project. It acts as the source of truth for code generation, content creation, and technical decisions.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Create a daily acoustic/electric guitar learning journey based on **1 chord a day**, focusing on:
* Clear pedagogical progression.
* Short, consistent practice (Micro-learning).
* Simple, motivating visuals.
* Content accessible to absolute beginners but scalable.

---

## 👤 Target Audience

* **Absolute beginners.**
* People who have tried to learn before and quit due to information overload.
* Users who prefer **short daily routines (5–10 min).**

**Constraint:** Assume **zero** prior musical knowledge. Avoid unexplained jargon.

---

## 🎸 Musical Guidelines

### Chords
* **Priority:** Open chords first (C, G, D, A, E, Am, Em, Dm).
* **Constraint:** Introduce **Barre chords (Pestanas)** only after a consolidated foundation.
* **Mandatory Info:**
    * Chord Name.
    * Diagram (Finger position).
    * Strings played vs. Strings muted.

### Progression
* One chord per day.
* Frequent review of previous chords.
* Simple combinations (e.g., C → G → Am → F [simplified]).

### Rhythm
* Simple strumming patterns first (e.g., ↓ ↓↑).
* Gradual introduction of variations.
* **Always** indicate suggested BPM.

---

## 🧠 Teaching Methodology

* **Micro-lessons:** Short and direct.
* **Spaced Repetition:** Revisit concepts.
* **Daily Structure (Mandatory):**
    1.  **What to practice today.**
    2.  **Common Mistake.**
    3.  **Practical Tip.**

*Example:*
> "Today, focus only on switching from Am to C without stopping the rhythm."

---

## 🧩 Content Structure

Each Day/Chord lesson must contain:
1.  Chord Name.
2.  Diagram (ASCII or Image reference).
3.  Simple explanation.
4.  Practical Exercise (1–3 minutes).
5.  Optional Challenge.

**Constraint:** Avoid long texts. Keep it actionable.

---

## ✍️ Tone of Voice

* Friendly.
* Motivating.
* **NOT** academic or professorial.

*Acceptable:* "You don't need to play perfectly, just consistently." / "If it hurts, stop. Pain is not progress."
*Avoid:* Excessive technical language, performance pressure, comparisons to professional musicians.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Engineering & Development Rules (MANDATORY)

These rules are strict constraints to avoid errors, rework, and bad UX.

### 1. 📱 Total Responsiveness
The system **MUST** work perfectly on:
* Mobile (Android/iOS)
* Tablets
* Laptops
* Large Monitors
* Smart TVs

**Technical Constraints:**
* Use **real responsive layouts** (Flexbox/CSS Grid).
* Use flexible units: `rem`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`.
* ❌ **PROHIBITED:** Fixed pixel widths that break on small screens.
* ❌ **PROHIBITED:** Desktop-only layouts or clipped content.

### 2. 🧩 Code Organization (DRY Principle)
* ❌ **Do not** create files that already exist.
* ❌ **Do not** duplicate components or functions.
* **Protocol:**
    1.  Check if it exists.
    2.  Reuse.
    3.  Refactor if necessary.
* **Structure:** Small components, single-responsibility functions, clear naming conventions (e.g., `ChordDiagram`, `DailyPractice`).

### 3. 🚀 Server Rules (Node.js)
* ❌ **Do not** run `npm run dev` repeatedly. Use **Nodemon**.
* **Port Management:** If starting a new server:
    1.  Identify the port in use.
    2.  Run `killport`.
    3.  Only then start the new instance.

### 4. 🛑 General Prohibitions
* **No "Gambiarras" (Kludges/Hacks):** Do not use temporary fixes as final solutions.
* **No Ignored Errors:** Console errors must be understood and fixed.
* **No Commented Dead Code:** Fix it or delete it.

---

## 🖼️ Media Quality Standards

### Visuals
* **High Quality:** No pixelated or stretched images.
* **Mandatory Lesson Angles:**
    * Full Guitar.
    * Player form **Front**.
    * Player from **Side**.
* **Clarity:** Body posture and arm positioning must be obvious.

### Audio
* Clean, noise-free, balanced volume.
* ❌ **PROHIBITED:** Low volume, clipping/distorted audio, untested video sound.

---

## ✋ Didactics (No Assumptions)

Never assume the user knows anatomy or music theory. Always explain:
* **Finger Mapping:** Thumb (Polegar), Index (Indicador), Middle (Médio), Ring (Anelar), Pinky (Mindinho).
* **Contact Points:** Exact string and fret.

---

## 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) – MANDATORY ARCHITECTURE

The app **MUST be bilingual** (PT-BR / EN-US) from the start, with architecture ready for ES, FR, IT, DE, ZH.

### 1. strict i18n Rules
* Use `i18next` / `react-i18next`.
* ❌ **PROHIBITED:** Hardcoded text in JSX/TSX/HTML.
* ✅ **REQUIRED:** All visible text must come from JSON locales.

*Bad:* `<button>Next Chord</button>`
*Good:* `<button>{t('common.nextChord')}</button>`

### 2. Folder Structure
Must match the current repository pattern:
```text
/src/i18n
  ├─ index.ts            # Configuration (Single entry point)
  └─ locales
     ├─ pt
     │  ├─ common.json
     │  ├─ lessons.json
     │  └─ ui.json
     └─ en
        ├─ common.json
        ├─ lessons.json
        └─ ui.json

```

### 3. File & Expansion Constraints

* **Limit:** No language file > 500 lines. Split by context if necessary.
* **Adding Languages:**
* Create the folder in `locales`.
* Translate the JSONs.
* Register in `index.ts`.
* ❌ **You MUST NOT touch any Component or Page code to add a language.**



### 4. Golden Rule of i18n

> "If adding a language requires changing a React component, the architecture is wrong."

---

## ✅ Definition of "Done"

A feature/screen is only **DONE** when:

1. It works on all resolutions (Mobile to TV).
2. Code is clean and logic is not duplicated.
3. It is crystal clear for a beginner.
4. Images and Audio are tested and working.
5. All text is fully internationalized.

---

📌 **Final Principle:**

> Clean code, clear screen, user understanding.
> If any of these fail, the work is **not ready**.
